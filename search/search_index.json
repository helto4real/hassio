Network For home users the default bridged network makes most sense so not extra network is configured. Multiple bridges can be created. For improved security, vlans can be setup. I might do this in a test environmet but will not use VLAN for now. Certificates I will use lets encrypt for certificate management. Todo: document this Add VM for Hassio Creating the virtual machine. Default values apply if not specified in the instructions or on image. Upload the ISO Download debian or what ever operating system you prefere. I use net install image of Debian 9. download here . Select amd64 CD or torrent if you prefer. Then select your ISO file and press Upload Add the VM General - Name: HASSIO - No resource pool OS - select your isofile and use rest default Hard disk I used 20 Gig as start disk, remember that the whole disk wont be allocated at once. This is the max size.

I used swedish as language and sweden as location - Choose host name, I use hassio - Set the root password - Set the non root name and username - Use whole disk and standard settings for partitioning - Use standard settings util you are at the software selection - Unselect debian environment and print server - Select \"SSH\" server, I am sure you want to connect remote to the machine - Install rest as default and reboot Screens from setup. (Sorry for Swedish): Install sudo Depending on your configuration you might need to install sudo. Enter su using $ su and enter password. Install sudo and add your user (the one you provided in installtime) and exit from su. $ apt-get install sudo $ adduser username sudo $ usermod -aG sudo youruser $ exit and the exit. Now you can use sudo for admin. if you get problems you might need to add the user in the sudoers file. $ su $ nano /etc/sudoers $ exit put the youruser ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL after root IP configuration If you want the default DHCP IP just skip this step # Log in as root or su to root then nano /etc/network/interfaces # Should look like this: source /etc/network/interfaces.d/* # The loopback network interface auto lo iface lo inet loopback # The primary network interface allow-hotplug eth0 iface eth0 inet dhcp then change to : # The primary network interface allow-hotplug eth0 iface eth0 inet static address 192.168.1.202 netmask 255.255.255.0 gateway 192.0.1.1 Make sure your settings are correct. In an VM the eth0 is probable something else. To list network interfaces write ip link show to get the correct one. You need to select the ethernet interface. Finalizing the setup Now it is a good time to make a snapshot. A snapshot is a point in time to restart from. - First make sure the latest updates and uppgrades are on the base operating syste before making snapshot. $ sudo apt-get update $ sudo apt-get upgrade $ exit go to the proxmox web interface and select your host ant then select \"snapshot\". Create the snapshot. Call it \"Fresh\". Now we always can start fresh after installing hassio and all other stuff. CONGRATULATIONS YOUR FIRST VM IS UP AND RUNNING! Proxmox backup One of the best features running virtual environments is the possibility to backup entire machine really easy. Here is docs about how that's done. Use usb disk Mount the USB drive If you are running a windows system, the drive is probably a NTFS drive. This guide assumes this but there are basically very few difference with other format types. For full descriptions go to this url $ fdisk -l lists your disks, make sure you can see your drive. Take not of drive path i.e. /dev/? $ mkdir /media/usb-drive makes mount point $ mount /dev/sdc1 /media/usb-drive/ (sdc1 will probably be another device id for you), check #1 $ mount | grep sdc1 , to check if mount went ok if you later want to unmount the usb, the command is umount /media/usb-drive . To PERMANENTLY MAKE MOUNT AVAILABLE ATT BOOT then do following. $ blkid -t TYPE=ntfs -sUUID Check your unique id of drive. The type can be vfat if not windows formatted. In the file /etc/fstab add the following UUID=702432D524329DD2 /media/usb-drive ntfs defaults 0 0 REMEMBER TO USER YOUR OWN UUID and other type than ntfs if your drive is formatted non ntfs! Please be VERY CAREFUL to make sure everything is correct. This is why you should try mount manually first Add drive to Proxmox In datacenter view, select Storage Click, \"Add->Directory\" set your settings and Save Now you can use the drive as target disk making backups in proxmox!. Schedule backups In datacenter view, select Backup Add a backupscheme and select your new backupdisk ZFS I am using the system setup as NAS. 4 identical disks 2xstripe mirrored. This is at good alternative for speed and safety. Find other options for disk configurations online. I have on-line backup of my NAS this is why I dont use a \"safer\" configturation.

What happens it your IoT device gets hacked. How do we make sure it doesnt have full access to your network? Do we know if and where it sends usage and private data? At least we can make sure we make basic setup of a good firewall and segmented networks using VLANS. We have a wonderful piece of machine in Intel NUC that have alot of machine power left so I decided to use it as a firewall/router too. I am using OpnSense software and an extra USB ethernet dongle on the WAN side. I bought two used managed gigabit switches with VLAN capabilites. I also use the Unifi AP capability to set VLAN id to a SSID for the guest wifi and IoT wifi/network. I will explain it in the following chapters. The reader takes own responsibility of the security using this guide! Proxmox setup Networking I have two networking devices. The built-in ethernet and the usb dongle. For a computer I would advice to buy a normal ethernet card but for a NUC the USB will be fine. I also have two \"Linux bridges\", one for WAN (the usb one) and one for the LAN. Very important to add the \"VLAN Aware\" checkbox. This will make the bridge work like a switch for VLANS. Install opnsense If you want you can read the full installation guide of opnsense. This is how I configured it. Upload the OpnSense image. Create the VM, I use 2048 MiB memory, 3 cores, 20gig storage. GuestOS=Other. Use default LAN network, my case vmbr0. Add the WAN network device Add the VLAN network device in my case with tag=xx Hardware should look something like this: Start the VM and go to console Wait for the installation to end When prompted, login as \"installer\" and password \"opnsense\". Install defaults, now the FW is listening to \"192.168.1.1\" IMPORTANT, remove ISO from CD for the VM!!!! If you forget this it will start in live mode and no settings will be saved. Use web browser to login to \"root\" and use \"opnsense\" as password. Do the wizard. A tip is to use the old routers MAC address if you have binding to outside IP addresses. After wizard is done you have a basic setup of firewalled WAN/LAN Example of VLAN, Guest network As an example I use VLAN for guest network Wifi. Same can be applied to setup VLAN for IoT network. If you used my example you will have three networking interfaces. Now it is time to configure VLAN for the third taged one.

Create new network. If you already have a guest wifi setup, make sure your VLAN tag is the same. You will find the VLAN setting under ADVANCED OPTIONS. If you want you can setup more advanced guest network capabilities, like \"apply guest policies\" settings. 2. Now you can use a device to connect to the new guest network and make sure it get correct ip and gateway. Also check if you can reach internet and not get to local LAN devices.

What happens it your IoT device gets hacked. How do we make sure it doesnt have full access to your network? Do we know if and where it sends usage and private data? At least we can make sure we make basic setup of a good firewall and segmented networks using VLANS. We have a wonderful piece of machine in Intel NUC that have alot of machine power left so I decided to use it as a firewall/router too. I am using OpnSense software and an extra USB ethernet dongle on the WAN side. I bought two used managed gigabit switches with VLAN capabilites. I also use the Unifi AP capability to set VLAN id to a SSID for the guest wifi and IoT wifi/network. I will explain it in the following chapters. The reader takes own responsibility of the security using this guide!","title":"Firewall setup"},{"location":"system/5_opnsense_firewall/#proxmox-setup","text":"","title":"Proxmox setup"},{"location":"system/5_opnsense_firewall/#networking","text":"I have two networking devices. The built-in ethernet and the usb dongle. For a computer I would advice to buy a normal ethernet card but for a NUC the USB will be fine. I also have two \"Linux bridges\", one for WAN (the usb one) and one for the LAN. Very important to add the \"VLAN Aware\" checkbox. This will make the bridge work like a switch for VLANS.","title":"Networking"},{"location":"system/5_opnsense_firewall/#install-opnsense","text":"If you want you can read the full installation guide of opnsense. This is how I configured it. Upload the OpnSense image. Create the VM, I use 2048 MiB memory, 3 cores, 20gig storage. GuestOS=Other. Use default LAN network, my case vmbr0. Add the WAN network device Add the VLAN network device in my case with tag=xx Hardware should look something like this: Start the VM and go to console Wait for the installation to end When prompted, login as \"installer\" and password \"opnsense\". Install defaults, now the FW is listening to \"192.168.1.1\" IMPORTANT, remove ISO from CD for the VM!!!! If you forget this it will start in live mode and no settings will be saved. Use web browser to login to \"root\" and use \"opnsense\" as password. Do the wizard. A tip is to use the old routers MAC address if you have binding to outside IP addresses. After wizard is done you have a basic setup of firewalled WAN/LAN","title":"Install opnsense"},{"location":"system/5_opnsense_firewall/#example-of-vlan-guest-network","text":"As an example I use VLAN for guest network Wifi.
